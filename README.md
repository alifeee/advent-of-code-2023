# Advent of Code 2023

My solutions for Advent of Code 2023. The language used may be anything. I started with `sh`. I don't know why. The final files have not been cleaned; there is a lot of commented experimentation (especially in the `sh` files).

## To run

### Bash solutions

Either `cat` the data file into the script file with a pipe, or give the filename as input to the script:

```bash
cat data/day1.txt | ./scripts/day01_1.sh
# or
./scripts/day01_1.sh data/day1.txt
```
